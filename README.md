# Simulation of a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process

The aim of this work is to reproduce the dynamics of a **Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process** through an agent based simulation on NetLogo. 

A TASEP is a traffic model that can be analytically studied. It is based on a one-dimensional lattice, where the particles are injected and extracted with fixed rates, and move only rightward if the adjacent site is empty. 
Varying these rates, the system displays different phases of the stationary state. In the file *Simulation of a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) to model vehicular traffic.pdf* a detailed description of the theoretical model, and of the simulation is
provided. Comparison between the analytically derived results and the simulation results in the different realizations of the dynamics are drawn.

The simulation running online is avaliable here (https://terna.to.it/tesineEconofisica/Simulation%20of%20a%20Totally%20Asymmetric%20Simple%20Exclusion%20Process%20(TASEP)%20to%20model%20vehicular%20traffic.html). Unfortunately the density evolution is not visualized instantaneously online: to visualize it  it is necessary to replay the bottom "Go" or to wait the end of the simulation.
